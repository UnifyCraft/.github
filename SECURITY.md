# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities in UnifyCraft
products should be reported in the
[Discord server][discord] using a support
ticket

Security/patch updates will be released on a regular basis for products
that require them, if a vulnerability is not deemed as severe enough for
a high priority status a fix is unlikely to be published within the first
business week of said vulnerability being reported.

## What happens in the event of an emergency

All affected UnifyCraft services will be taken offline temporarily
while a fix is implemented. If the threat affecting these services
is not too severe we will allow them to remain active while we
mitigate the issues. All issues you have should be reported while
following the instructions set in
[Reporting a Vulnerability](#reporting-a-vulnerability).
