# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities in UnifyCraft products can be reported either on
the project's public GitHub repository or in our [Discord server][discord].

Security/patch updates will be released on a regular basis for products
that require them, if a vulnerability is not deemed as severe enough for
a high priority status a fix is unlikely to be published within the first
business week of said vulnerability being reported.
