# Support

If your problem involves a vulnerability in one
of our products or services, please create a private
support ticket in [our Discord server][discord] so we
can privately fix this issue and not draw attention to
it.

If you have a question, concern or a problem that does
not involve a vulnerability in our technologies, please
create an issue on the project's public GitHub repository.
If the project does not have a public GitHub repository
or you feel that your issue requires more in-depth
explanation, please open a support ticket in
